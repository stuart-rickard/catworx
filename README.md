## Description

This project is based on a coding course from [edX](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps).

It creates employee badges using the C# language and the SkiaSharp package to create the graphics for the badge.

Includes an option to collect random employee data (name and image) from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) API.

The JSON collected from the API is converted into C# data types using the `System.Text.Json` namespace. (This is a little different from the lesson, which suggested using the Newtonsoft.Json package. I wanted to try the "official" way.)
